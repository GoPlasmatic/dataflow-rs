# Task Functions

Task functions are responsible for processing and transforming messages after they have been ingested into the system. They perform operations such as enrichment, data manipulation, and validation/condition checks to prepare the message for downstream processing.

## Overview

Task functions operate on messages to enhance and modify their content. They can interact with external systems to enrich messages, manipulate data structures, and validate or apply conditional checks to ensure that messages conform to business logic.

## Categories of Task Functions

- **Enrichment Functions**
  - **API Enrichment:** Call external APIs to fetch data and merge the results into the message. Examples include fetching weather data, news, or cat facts.
  - **Database Fetch:** Retrieve additional data from databases (SQL, NoSQL) to augment message information.
  - **Third-Party Integrations:** Integrate with external services (e.g. CRM, ERP systems) to pull or push data.

- **Data Manipulation Functions**
  - **Transformation:** Modify the structure or format of message data, such as remapping fields or reformatting content.
  - **Aggregation and Splitting:** Combine data points into a single message or split a message into multiple parts for parallel processing.

- **Validation and Condition Functions**
  - **Combined Validation/Condition Checks:** Validate that the message data meets required schemas and business rules. They may also perform conditional checks to determine subsequent processing logic. Routing decisions can be based on events generated from these checks.

## Implementation Considerations

- Ensure robust error handling and logging when interacting with external services.
- Adopt asynchronous processing where high throughput is required.
- Normalize data formats to maintain consistency across different task functions.
- Leverage combined validation and condition logic to simplify routing based on message state.
