# Built-in Functions Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the built-in functions available in the system. They are split into two main categories:

- [Source Functions](SOURCE_FUNCTIONS.md): These functions are responsible for ingesting external events and converting them into messages.
- [Task Functions](TASK_FUNCTIONS.md): These functions process messages by performing enrichment, data manipulation, and combined validation/condition checks.
