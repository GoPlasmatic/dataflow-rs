---

Dataflow-rs is a Rust library for creating high-performance data processing pipelines with pre-compiled JSONLogic and zero runtime overhead. It features a modular architecture that separates compilation from execution, ensuring predictable low-latency performance. Whether you're building REST APIs, processing Kafka streams, or creating sophisticated data transformation pipelines, Dataflow-rs provides enterprise-grade performance with minimal complexity.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Zero Runtime Compilation:** All JSONLogic expressions pre-compiled at startup for optimal performance.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation between compilation (LogicCompiler) and execution (InternalExecutor).
- **Direct DataLogic Instantiation:** Each engine has its own DataLogic instance for zero contention.
- **Immutable Workflows:** Workflows compiled once at initialization for predictable performance.
- **Dynamic Workflows:** Use JSONLogic to control workflow execution based on your data.
- **Extensible:** Easily add your own custom processing steps (tasks) to the engine.
- **Built-in Functions:** Comes with thread-safe implementations of HTTP requests, data mapping, and validation.
- **Resilient:** Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms to handle transient failures.
- **Auditing:** Keep track of all the changes that happen to your data as it moves through the pipeline.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Here's a quick example to get you up and running.

### 1. Add to `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
dataflow-rs = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

### 2. Create a Workflow

Workflows are defined in JSON and consist of a series of tasks.

```json
{
    "id": "data_processor",
    "name": "Data Processor",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "id": "fetch_data",
            "function": {
                "name": "http",
                "input": { "url": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1" }
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "transform_data",
            "function": {
                "name": "map",
                "input": {
                    "mappings": [
                        {
                            "path": "data.user_name",
                            "logic": { "var": "temp_data.body.name" }
                        },
                        {
                            "path": "data.user_email",
                            "logic": { "var": "temp_data.body.email" }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### 3. Run the Engine

```rust
use dataflow_rs::{Engine, Workflow};
use dataflow_rs::engine::message::Message;
use serde_json::json;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Define workflows
    let workflow_json = r#"{ ... }"#; // Your workflow JSON from above
    let workflow = Workflow::from_json(workflow_json)?;
    
    // Create engine with workflows (immutable after creation)
    let engine = Engine::new(
        vec![workflow],  // Workflows to compile and cache
        None,           // Use default built-in functions
        None,           // Use default custom functions
        None,           // Use default DataLogic
        None,           // Use default retry config
    );

    // Process a single message
    let mut message = Message::new(&json!({}));
    engine.process_message(&mut message).await?;

    println!("‚úÖ Processed result: {}", serde_json::to_string_pretty(&message.data)?);

    Ok(())
}
```

### 4. Parallel Processing with Multiple Engines

For parallel processing, create multiple engine instances across threads:

```rust
use dataflow_rs::{Engine, Workflow};
use dataflow_rs::engine::message::Message;
use serde_json::json;
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::task::JoinSet;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Define your workflows
    let workflow_json = r#"{ ... }"#; // Your workflow JSON
    let workflow = Workflow::from_json(workflow_json)?;
    let workflows = vec![workflow];

    // Process messages in parallel using multiple engine instances
    let mut tasks = JoinSet::new();
    
    for i in 0..1000 {
        let workflows_clone = workflows.clone();
        tasks.spawn(async move {
            // Each task creates its own engine instance (zero contention)
            let engine = Engine::new(workflows_clone, None, None, None, None);
            let mut message = Message::new(&json!({"id": i}));
            engine.process_message(&mut message)
        });
    }

    // Wait for all messages to complete
    while let Some(result) = tasks.join_next().await {
        result??;
    }

    println!("‚úÖ Processed 1000 messages in parallel!");
    Ok(())
}
```

## ‚ú® Core Concepts

- **Engine:** High-performance engine with pre-compiled logic and immutable workflows.
- **LogicCompiler:** Compiles all JSONLogic expressions at initialization for zero runtime overhead.
- **InternalExecutor:** Executes built-in functions using pre-compiled logic from the cache.
- **Workflow:** A sequence of tasks executed in order, with conditions accessing only metadata.
- **Task:** A single processing step with optional JSONLogic conditions.
- **Message:** The data structure flowing through workflows with audit trail support.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The v3.0 architecture focuses on simplicity and performance through clear separation of concerns:

### Compilation Phase (Startup)
1. **LogicCompiler** compiles all JSONLogic expressions from workflows and tasks
2. Creates an indexed cache of compiled logic for O(1) runtime access
3. Validates all logic expressions early, failing fast on errors
4. Stores compiled logic in contiguous memory for cache efficiency

### Execution Phase (Runtime)
1. **Engine** orchestrates message processing through immutable workflows
2. **InternalExecutor** evaluates conditions and executes built-in functions
3. Uses compiled logic from cache - zero compilation overhead at runtime
4. Direct DataLogic instantiation eliminates any locking or contention

### Key Design Decisions
- **Immutable Workflows:** All workflows defined at engine creation, cannot be modified
- **Pre-compilation:** All expensive parsing/compilation done once at startup
- **Direct Instantiation:** Each engine owns its DataLogic instance directly
- **Modular Design:** Clear boundaries between compilation, execution, and orchestration

## ‚ö° Performance

Dataflow-rs achieves optimal performance through architectural improvements:

- **Pre-Compilation:** All JSONLogic compiled at startup, zero runtime overhead
- **Cache-Friendly:** Compiled logic stored contiguously in memory
- **Direct Instantiation:** DataLogic instances created directly without locking
- **Predictable Latency:** No runtime allocations for logic evaluation
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of compilation and execution phases

Run the included benchmark to test performance on your hardware:
```bash
cargo run --example benchmark
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom Functions

You can extend the engine with your own custom logic by implementing the `FunctionHandler` trait:

```rust
use dataflow_rs::engine::{FunctionHandler, error::Result, message::{Change, Message}};
use serde_json::Value;

pub struct MyCustomFunction;

impl FunctionHandler for MyCustomFunction {
    fn execute(
        &self, 
        message: &mut Message, 
        input: &Value,
    ) -> Result<(usize, Vec<Change>)> {
        // Your custom logic here
        println!("Hello from a custom function!");
        
        // Modify message data
        message.data["processed"] = json!(true);
        
        // Return status code and changes for audit trail
        Ok((200, vec![Change {
            path: "data.processed".to_string(),
            old_value: json!(null),
            new_value: json!(true),
            operation: "set".to_string(),
        }]))
    }
}

// Register when creating the engine:
let mut custom_functions = HashMap::new();
custom_functions.insert(
    "my_custom_function".to_string(),
    Box::new(MyCustomFunction) as Box<dyn FunctionHandler + Send + Sync>
);

let engine = Engine::new(
    workflows,
    None,  // Use default built-ins
    Some(custom_functions),
    None,  // Use default DataLogic
    None,  // Use default retry config
);
```
